# CRUtils
A simple utility application made by [picolino0](https://www.github.com/picolino0) that does a couple of random things. This project is not really made to be used by anyone aside from the creator. Its was made (and functions are still being added to it occasionally) because there was a need for it. Who has time to search google for an application that already does that stuff, right?

## Features
 - Simulate the play/pause and next/previous buttons (in case you don't have them under your `Fn` key
 - Show a popup box when the `printscreen` button is pressed with a screenshot of all screens separately and save one of them to a adjustable folder
 
## User interface
The application is currently under development. This readme will be updated later.
